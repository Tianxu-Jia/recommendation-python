Ensuring our builds compile correctly and pass all automated tests consistently is essential for a reliable CI/CD pipeline. Testing is the backbone of our CI/CD pipeline. By ensuring all deployments go through the pipeline, we\u2019re guaranteeing consistent testing and quality checks. Consequently, we need to keep an eye on key metrics like build success rates, test coverage, deployment time, and more. In this article, we\u2019ve explored a handful of key CI/CD best practices that can transform the way our team builds and delivers software.",
